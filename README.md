# **Keras Hub & Teachable Machines**  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains implementations of **Google’s Teachable Machine** models and **small variations of Keras Hub examples**. The goal is to explore machine learning through interactive, easy-to-use tools while modifying existing deep-learning models for different tasks.  

Each section includes **Colab notebooks** and a **YouTube tutorial** explaining the implementation in detail.
